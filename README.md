<b>CodeAcademy JavaScript Project: Kelvin Weather</b>
<p>(From the course: Learn JavaScript)</p>

<p>Description: <br>
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there's a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin. With our knowledge of JavaScript, let's convert Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit and Newton.

<p>I was attempting the Kelvin Weather JavaScript project on CodeAcademy and thought, "Mr Kelvin deserves better, let's give him a webpage too while I'm at it!". <br>
So here it is, a simple front-end edition.</p>

<br>
<p>Browser Version: <a href="https://ee-tee.github.io/kelvin-weather/">https://ee-tee.github.io/kelvin-weather/</a></p>
<p>(kelvinWeatherWeb.js)</p>

<p>Normal Version:</p>
<p>(kelvinWeather.js)</p>
